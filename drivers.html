										<h2>Driver Installation</h2>
									</header>

									<p>While some SDRs are automatically recognized by Windows, many RTL-SDRs and similar SDRs still require manual driver installation. The most popular way to do this is with <a target='_blank' href='https://zadig.akeo.ie/'>Zadig</a>. On paper, Zadig does support ARM64 for WinUSB and libusb-win32 backends - but there's a catch (of course). <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/issues/289'>As is documented in this issue</a>, Zadig cannot install drivers on Windows for ARM64 with Driver Signature Enforcement enabled. The general impression is that the bug is on the Windows side, but Pete Batard (Zadig/libwdi's developer) has opened the door to others who can help with the issue.
									</p>
									<p>To further complicate the issue, booting Snapdragon X laptops without Driver Signature Enforcement can be problematic. On my machines, it simply boots to recovery if I attempt to disable it through Advanced Startup. There is a solution through disabling secure boot and some bcdedit commands - but this method is insecure. If you can rely on WinUSB (and most SDRs can), you can avoid the issue altogether by using Device Manager itself, and a registry edit for the trickier SDRs.
									</p>

									<h3>Manual WinUSB Installation</h3>

									<p style='margin-bottom: 1em;'><i>These directions are adapted from <a target='_blank' href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/winusb-installation#installing-winusb-by-specifying-the-system-provided-device-class'>the official Microsoft instructions</a> for this specific use case.</i></p>
									<ol>
										<li>Plug in your SDR
										<li>Right-click on the Start button and choose "Device Manager"
											<br /><img src='/images/driver1.png' />
										<li>You should find your SDR under "Other Devices". With some SDRs, there may be more than one device shown. These are known as Composite Devices.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver2a.png' />
										<li>If you are in this situation, double-click on one and go to Details &gt; Hardare Ids. For RTL-SDRs, you want to choose the one that ends in MI_00, as shown here. <b>Take note of this hardware ID for later</b>.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver2b.png' />
										<li>Whether your SDR shows as one device or two, go to the Driver tab and click Update Driver.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver2c.png' />
										<li>Choose "Browse my computer for drivers."
											<br /><img src='/images/driver3.png' />
										<li>Click "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer."
											<br /><img src='/images/driver4.png' />
										<li>From the list, pick "Universal Serial Bus devices" and click Next.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver5.png' />
										<li>Click "WinUsb Device" on both the left and right, then click Next.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver6.png' />
										<li>Windows will complain that the driver is not recommended. Too bad - we know better. Click Yes.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver7.png' />
										<li>Windows will now inform you that the driver installation has succeded.
									</ol>

									<h3>Additional Steps for Composite Devices</h3>

									<p>If you only had one unknown device in step 3 - that's all you need to do! You are ready to use your SDR in your favorite program. However, if you had a composite device, there are additional steps.
									</p>
									<ol start="12">
										<li>Open PowerShell and type New-Guid. Save the generated GUID for later.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver8.png' />
										<li>Right-click on the start button and "Run"
											<br /><img src='/images/driver9.png' />
										<li>Type "regedit", then click OK
											<br /><img src='/images/driver10.png' />
										<li>In regedit, go to <u style="line-break: anywhere;">Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB</u> and look for the device ID you found in step 4 of the main installation instructions. Open the Device Parameters folder that is nested one under the Device ID.
											<br /><img src='/images/driver11.png' />
										<li>Right-click in the white space and go to New > String Value
											<br /><img src='/images/driver12.png' />
										<li>Name the value "DeviceInterfaceGUID"
											<br /><img src='/images/driver13.png' />
										<li>Double-click on your newly created registry key, and set it to the GUID you created in step 1, surrounded by {}
											<br /><img src='/images/driver14.png' />
										<li>Unplug and re-plug your SDR into the same port, and that's it! You should now be able to use your SDR in your favorite program.
